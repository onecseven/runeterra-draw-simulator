* Simulating hands
** INPUT: 40 card deck, a set of mulligan queries, 
          a set of full hand queries,
          and a number of simulations to be ran
** OUTPUT: X number of simulated hands, interpreted through the queries to keep the matching ones.
** DONE Step 1. We need an input component for the amount of hands that we need simulated.
** DONE Step 2. Once we have that amount, we begin by shuffling once
** TODO We have to reorganize the state-tree
