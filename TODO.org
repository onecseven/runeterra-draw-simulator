* Deck-Creator
** TODO Initial Mulligan has got to be fixed.
It still has the deprecated ~draw~ and we probably need to make it so it doesn't mutate the deck...
* Mulliganer
** TODO We need to componetize this
It's kind of like too big a system to understand in its entirety right now, but
we might make it so that we can abstract out its logic into the tag system.
* Runeterra Info Handler
** Tasklist
*** DONE install lor code decode
*** DONE use the Deck-Code-Lookup to get the names of the cards
*** DONE run it through a transform, to turn into an array of [{code: '', name: ''}]
*** TODO once we have this array, use it as a dictionary with the created decks
*** TODO deck-code-lookup error handling
*** example     
input: shuffled array of numbers
output: shuffled array of cards
the numbers correspond to their place in the array
ie.
in: [2,13,20]
out: [cards[2], cards[13], cards[20]]
"cards" here being the translated deck from line 23

* Tag System Brainstorm
** TODO Think about this
