* TAG SYSTEM
** Design
The tag system is meant to be used in the following way:
- The user selects a card
- This card is 'tagged'
- The tags are stored in tagSlice
- Every tag contains a reference to its 'counter'
- Before the simulation is run, we create a 'decorated' deck,
  where the card objects are applied their tags in their object
- When the simulation runs, after the mulligan phase, and once we have 'drawn'
  the amount of cards the user specified, we go through the 'hand' again
  and count the tags. For every tag that is hit, we update the counter object
- At the end of the simulation, it is the counter data that will be counted and
  displayed, as they will contain the relevant information.
